The API allows performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on company employees, as well as supporting authentication and authorization via JWT (JSON Web Token).

## Authentication & Authorization
Authentication: Each user must log in to receive a JWT token. This token should be passed in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
Authorization: Only users with the admin role can perform certain operations, such as deleting and updating users.
Example Authorization Header:

Authorization: **Bearer <your_jwt_token>**

Running the Project
To run the project, use the following command: **npm run nodemon**

This will start the server if you intsall nodemon or you can use node server.js.

**Testing the Endpoints**

You can use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test the API endpoints. Ensure that you pass the JWT token for authorized routes such as GET /api/get-user, PUT /api/update-user, and DELETE /api/delete-user.

**Conclusion**

This API allows managing a company's employees with a secure authentication mechanism and a flexible admin interface to perform CRUD operations. Use the endpoints to register, login, update, delete, and search for employees.
